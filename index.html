            & Charlotte were mesmerized by nature showing itself at its best and at the same time being confronted 
            with how mass consumerism and the production of cheap plastic has led to enormous plastic waste pollution we all know today.
            This led to the creation of The Plaf, also known as The Plastic Flamingo, a social enterprise 
            based in the Philippines that collects and transforms plastic waste into a range of sustainable 
            construction materials which can be used to build new schools, housing, and shelters to help make 
            this country more resilient against its many natural hazards the country faces yearly.</p></div>
            <div class="col2"><h1>What has the Plastic Flamingo done so far?</h1><p>convert plastic waste 
                and through a process of collecting, sorting, and shredding, its facility recycle plastic 
                waste into durable new. products that are implemented in projects like decking, fencing, 
                and outdoor furniture. It also managed hundreds of metric tons of plastic waste from the 
                plastic collection sites it has established through organizations, companies, and dedicated 
                individuals.
