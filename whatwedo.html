    <h1>Initiatives</h1> <p>Our goal is to educate and share knowledge about 
        our advocacy. We have hosted numerous webinars reaching thousands of attendees. 
        Our online community has gathered a huge amount of followers, especially on Facebook, 
        encouraging others to learn about the plastic recycling industry and other important issues.</p>

    <h1>Involvements</h1><p>The Plastic Flamingo has already managed hundreds of metric tons of plastic waste from the plastic collection sites it has established through organizations, companies, and dedicated individuals.Through our continuous efforts, The Plaf is dedicated to a number of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our warehouse workers and waste collectors come from low-income families, providing them with livelihoods where they can upskill and seek more opportunities.

    <h1>Activities and Participation</h1><p>In 2015, the United Nations (UN) adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which would replace the Millennium Development Goals that stood from 2000 to 2015.

        These goals aim to call to action all countries in a global partnership to fight poverty, inequality and injustice and tackle climate change by 2030. Thus, encouraging businesses and companies to integrate them in their strategies.
        
         The range of the challenges stated by the SDGs impacts all companies in at least one of their spectra of activity, whether it is investments, business model or practices.</p>
